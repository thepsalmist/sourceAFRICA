  We're here to help you with sourceAFIRCA accounts or questions about the service. There are several ways to get in touch with us; check the section below that best fits what you need.

  <h2>Getting a sourceAFIRCA account</h2>
  <p>Generally, sourceAFRICA accounts are available to those who report on primary source documents. User accounts are organization-based, meaning that each user is connected to an overall organization account.</p>

  
  <p>There are several ways to get started with a sourceAFRICA account:</p>
  
  <p>If you belong to a news organization, first check whether it's already a sourceAFRICA contributor. If so, a person at your site with administrative privileges on sourceAFRICA can create an account for you. If you don't know who that is, we can help you. Email us at <a href="mailto:support@codeforafrica.org?subject=sourceAFRICA+Account+Help">support@codeforafrica.org</a>.
  
  <p>If your organization is not yet a sourceAFRICA contributor, you can <a href="mailto:info@codeforafrica.org?subject=sourceAFRICA+Joining">request an organization account</a>. We will need the following from your editor or editorial director: a note (email is fine) granting permission to add your newsroom to our public list of <a href="/contributors">document contributors</a>; confirmation that they understand you'll be contributing documents to a public catalog and approve your participation in sourceAFRICA; and confirmation you have read and agree to our <a href="https://sourceafrica.net/terms">Terms of Service</a>. Once we receive this from your editor, expect to be up and running within two weeks.</p>

  <p>At its discretion, sourceAFRICA provides accounts to those who do document-based investigative reporting but are not employees of a news organization. Examples include freelancers on a specific assignment or educational uses. Requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. In general, we do not provide accounts until the website that will host the documents is live or can be previewed. When applying, please show us some of your reporting and tell us about the kind of documents you work with. Also, please provide the name of the website on which you'll be publishing the documents and a contact there.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are able to provide demo accounts to those who wish to evaluate the service but not publish documents. <a href="mailto:info@codeforafrica.org?subject=sourceAFRICA+Demo">Contact us</a> to learn more.</p>
